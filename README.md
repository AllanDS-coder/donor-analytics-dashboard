## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of donor data trends and engagement behaviors over a three-year period (FY2022â€“FY2024). The goal was to develop a dynamic and interactive dashboard to support donor cultivation strategies and optimize fundraising efforts for a mid-sized nonprofit organization.

**Note:** Organization names and donor data have been anonymized or synthetically generated to protect confidentiality. This project reflects the analytical and technical skills used in real-world donor management settings.

##  Data Privacy & Ethics

This project was inspired by real donor analytics work. However:

- All donor names, contact details, and donation values have been **synthetically generated** or **altered**.
- Any resemblance to real individuals or organizations is coincidental.
- The name **"MCBertyd Foundation"** is a placeholder for demonstration purposes.

The ethical handling of donor data is a top priority, and this project complies with best practices in data protection.

## Use Case

This project demonstrates my capabilities in:

- Building end-to-end data apps for nonprofit fundraising strategy  
- Applying data science to relationship management and segmentation  
- Designing intuitive interfaces for non-technical stakeholders  
- Transforming raw datasets into actionable insights  

It is intended to showcase technical and analytical skills relevant to **Data Analyst**, **BI Developer**, and **Data Science** roles, particularly in the nonprofit, CRM, or fundraising sectors.
